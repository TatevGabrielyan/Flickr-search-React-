# react-redux-flickr-search

On the main page we have a search bar where we can search for images of different types, ex: cats, dogs, buildings etc. 
When searching for images only 5 images appear on the page from flicker. Then we will try to create drag and drop so that to drag pictures and drop them in their appropriate baskets.


You can see the **[demo here](http://react-redux-flickr-search.s3-website.eu-west-3.amazonaws.com)**.
